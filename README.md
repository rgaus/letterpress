# Ryan's Letterpress

I designed and built this letterpress from scratch. It's roughly patterned after a Chandler-Price new style, though a bit smaller.

Further documentation and build videos can be found here: https://bit.ly/diy-letterpress

## How to view/edit the CAD Model
Before we get started: clone this repository down locally to your system, or [click here](https://github.com/rgaus/letterpress/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip the file that's downloaded.

Also, download and install Autodesk Fusion 360 (the hobbiest version is free!): https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal

1. Within Fusion 360, open up the sidebar and click `New Project`. Give the project a name:

2. Click on the project you just created, and click `Upload`:

3. Click `Select Files` and select the `Full Assembly.f3d` file in the root of the repository.

4. After processing the file, Fusion 360 should have imported all the subassemblies within the model.

5. Now, go back to the model, and double click on the `Full Assembly` entry.

6. The complete model should be visible!
